Creates a TypeScript project with preferred defaults for compilation configuration and a few helpful task/launch configurations for common user actions.

Local PC installation:
- Clone this project to somewhere on your local PC
- Compile the TypeScript to Javascript by running `tsc` in the project's directory
- Run `npm install -g path-to-cloned-package-folder`

After installing, you will be able to run `create-ts-project <PROJECT_NAME>` and the generator will create a TypeScript project with the name `<PROJECT_NAME>` in the current working directory.
